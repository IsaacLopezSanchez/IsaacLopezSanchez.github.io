### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorites because I was still very new to coding.
    I was so exited to start learning it although I couldn't even start because
    I was struggling to set my laptop up for coding. Thankfully they helped me,
    and I was able to start on my coding Journey.

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because I was curious about
    how the game Blackjack works as I played it once but never really
    understand it. I also really liked this lab because I had a great
    lab partner that really helped me get a better understanding of coding.

  * Lab 12
      Lab 12, was one of my favorite lab although it is new it really
      shows me how far I have come with coding. Although I feel as I
      may need more practice(a lot more). I can really say that I enjoy
      coding and seeing the progress I have made thanks to my hard work
      and with the help of others that guided me in my journey.
